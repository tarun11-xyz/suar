# 🤖🎙️ SUAR: Systematic User Assistant Robot – A Voice-Controlled Python Assistant

SUAR (Systematic User Assistant Robot) is a lightweight and beginner-friendly voice-controlled desktop assistant built in Python 🐍. It responds to the wake word **"suar"**, listens to your commands, and performs tasks like opening websites or playing music. This project is ideal for learning about voice recognition, speech-to-text, and Python automation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🗣️ **Wake Word Detection** – Activates on "suar"
- 🎧 **Speech Recognition** – Uses Google's speech API
- 🗨️ **Text-to-Speech** – Speaks responses using `pyttsx3`
- 🌐 **Web Automation** – Opens:
  - Google
  - YouTube
  - Facebook
  - GitHub
  - Instagram
- 🎶 **Play Music** – Plays songs via a custom `musicLib`
- ❌ **Error Handling** – Gracefully handles exceptions
- 🔁 **Continuous Listening** – Listens for commands in a loop

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### 📦 Requirements

Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed. Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
````

> ⚠️ **Note:** If you face issues with `pyaudio` installation on Windows, try:
>
> ```bash
> pip install pipwin
> pipwin install pyaudio
> ```

### 📁 Folder Structure

```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. SUAR greets you with a welcome message 🎉
2. Listens for the **wake word**: `"suar"`
3. Once activated, waits for a **voice command**
4. Executes commands like:

   * `"open google"` → Opens Google
   * `"open youtube"` → Opens YouTube
   * `"play despacito"` → Plays the song from `musicLib`

---

## ▶️ Run the Project

```bash
python suar.py
```

Make sure your microphone 🎤 is enabled and working properly.

## 📌 To-Do (Optional Enhancements)

* [ ] Add more websites or dynamic command handling
* [ ] Integrate ChatGPT API for open-ended queries
* [ ] Improve wake word accuracy with NLP
* [ ] Add GUI using Tkinter or PyQt
